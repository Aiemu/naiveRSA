Since I used python to complete the implementation, no executable file was generated. Instead, two script files are used to directly start the program.

Before starting, please make sure you have installed python3.6+ and pip. If you are windows, double-click win.bat to run it.

If it is linux, macOS or any other unix-like OS, double-click unix_like.sh. If you click unix_like.sh and the pop-up is editing interface, please start the program according to the instructions in the document, or run the following command in the terminal to run the script:

chmod +x ./unix_like.sh
./unix_like.sh
